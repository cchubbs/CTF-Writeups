# Description

We had a blast at the BYU Cybersecurity Student Symposium this year! In the Threat Intelligence session, Jake, Carson, and Isaac split a flag up across 3 presentations. What was it?

Flag format: byuctf{flaghere}

# Solve

## Possible Solve #1:
1. Attend the BYU Cybersecurity Student Symposium
2. Jake, Carson, and Isaac had a flag split up in their respective presentations. Participants would need to take a picture of each slide across the presentations and piece them together to submit during the CTF.

## Possible Solve #2:
It's understandable that participants may not have attended the symposium. There is another way, which is much more difficult, but possible. You would have to get each individual part from various parts around the internet.
1. You can get Jake's part by simply looking up "Jake Mullins cybersecurity symposium" and that would reveal his flag.
2. Carson slides are on his github in a public repository. Searching for his github would reveal his slides, as well as his part of the flag. You can find his Github under the official BYU-CSA github, using the *People* tab and from there finding his slides on the profile.
3. Isaac's slides can be found actually idk

Piecing everything together will give you:
Flag: byuctf{g0_t0_symp051uM_n3x7_y34r!}

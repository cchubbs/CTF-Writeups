# Description

While BYU competed in the 2023 National NCAE competition, Professor Albert Tay went on a journey to seek out the holiest of fried chicken for his team. While driving down the US 41 he spotted two options right across the street from each other, but ultimately made the right choice.

The BYU team received the chicken before the end of the competition with much rejoicing!

What are the coordinates of the restaurant Albert went to? Round the coordinates to three decimal places.

# Solve

1. Discover where the NCAE 2023 Championships were held using Instagram or the NCAE website. A quick Google search on Instagram search will reveal that they were held in Tampa.
2. Using an online maps platform, look at Fried Chicken joints near Tampa. Church's Texas Chicken should jump out because the whole challenge description is filled with religious references.
3. There are 4 in the area, you can verify the exact location Albert visited because it is across the street from a KFC and it is on the US 41.
4. I would recommend using an address to coordinate converter, OR right-clicking on the location in Google Maps.
5. The flag is byuctf{27.996, -82.424}

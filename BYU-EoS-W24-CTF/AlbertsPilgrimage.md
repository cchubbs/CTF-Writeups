While BYU competed in the 2023 National NCAE competition, Albert was on a religious quest to a synagogue, with the intent to feed his team with the only fried chicken worthy of worship. Where did he go?
Submission format: if the challenge location was the BYU clocktower, your flag would be byuctf{40.2528,-111.6476}. Round the coordinates to 4 decimal places
Flag: byuctf{27.9958,-82.4242}
Solve steps:
1. Discover where the NCAE 2023 Championships were held using Instagram or the NCAE website (Tampa)
2. Look at Fried Chicken joints near Tampa. Church's Texas Chicken should jump out because the whole challenge description is filled with religious references.
3. Try the coordinates for each Church's. There are 4 in the area, Albert went to the one on Hillsborough.
4. I would recommend using an address to coordinate converter.
